# Causal Unicast Protocol Demo

## How to run demo
```bash
$ make clean && make
$ bash run.sh
```

Some output will be displayed in terminal. Formatted log is stored in
`data/unicast.log`.

## Configuration
Configuration file is stored in `data/unicast.conf`. The format is
similar to the UNICAST_EXAMPLE.

## Makefile
* Compile `$ make`
* Clean obj `$ make clean`
* Clean all `$ make remove`

## Run shell
* `$ bash run.sh`

The script automatically creates five processes. Each process is
assigned id from 0 to 4, and port from 9000 to 9001. The IP addresses
are all "127.0.0.1" (the localhost).

The processes will be killed after 30 seconds (it can be modified in
`run.sh`).

As Linux kernel does not support to close socket in terminal line, and
the processes are killed by SIGKILL, please make sure that the interval
of each two executions is at least 1 minute.

## Run exec
* `$ bin/unicast PROC_ID PROC_ID`

The server needs 10 seconds to set up and finish the configuration (most time is spent on waiting other severs to set up).
